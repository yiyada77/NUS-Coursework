1.You should run data_process.m to get face.mat file.
2.For PCA, LDA and SVM, they only have 1 file, so just click the run. For SVM, you should install LibSVM this toolbox before you run.
3.For CNN, there are 3 .m files, you can run faceCNN_init.m first, then faceCNN, finally the plot_acc.m.
4.face.mat for PCA, LDA and SVM, and faceCNN.mat for CNN.

If you have any problems for execution, please e-mail to me. Thank you very much ! :)
